# Random-OpenCV-Python-Projects
These are some random mini OpenCV Python Projects that i have done during my university days. Feel free to use, edit or modify my codes as you like. These codes may help you understand about various aspects of OpenCV and Python.
## Project List ##
* **[Image De-Noising](https://github.com/S-Rawther/Random-OpenCV-Python-Projects/tree/main/Image-Denoising)**
